# Phase 00 Baseline

Date: 2026-05-01

Branch/checkpoint: `audit/baseline-guardrails`

## Scope

Phase 00 installed repository-level remediation guidance and captured the local baseline verification status. No runtime behavior or production source code was changed.

## GitHub/Remote

- Phase 00 recorded `origin`: `https://github.com/flynn33/Forsetti-Framework.git`
- Current repository remote: `https://github.com/flynn33/Forsetti-Framework-Mac-iOS.git`
- Default branch checked out before Phase 00 branch creation: `main`
- Phase branch created locally: `audit/baseline-guardrails`

## Guidance Installed

- Added root `REPOSITORY_RULES.md` from the remediation package as repository-level guidance.

The remediation package itself remains outside the repository workspace.

## Baseline Verification

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `swift package dump-package` | Not run successfully: `swift` is not recognized as a command in this Windows environment. |
| `swift test --parallel --enable-code-coverage` | Not run successfully: `swift` is not recognized as a command in this Windows environment. |
| `swiftlint lint --strict --config .swiftlint.yml` | Not run successfully: `swiftlint` is not recognized as a command in this Windows environment. |
| `xcodebuild -scheme ForsettiFramework-Package -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' build` | Not run successfully: `xcodebuild` is not recognized as a command in this Windows environment. |
| `./Scripts/verify-forsetti-guardrails.sh` | Not run successfully: `bash` resolves to WSL, but WSL has no installed distributions. |

## Environment Notes

This local machine does not currently have the Apple/Swift verification toolchain required by the remediation package:

- Swift toolchain unavailable on PATH.
- SwiftLint unavailable on PATH.
- Xcode/xcodebuild unavailable on PATH.
- WSL bash cannot execute because no WSL distribution is installed.

Full Phase 00 verification still needs to be run on macOS with Xcode and SwiftLint installed, or in another environment that provides the required Swift package toolchain and guardrail script support.

## Runtime Behavior

No runtime source files were modified in Phase 00.
