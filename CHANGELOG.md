# Changelog

All notable changes to Forsetti Framework are documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added a tracked downloadable wiki archive at `docs/wiki/Forsetti-Framework-Mac-iOS-wiki-pages.zip` and linked it from the README documentation section.
- Added documentation alignment coverage for the current package products, version workflow, live wiki maintenance model, and commercial-license availability.
- Added repository-level remediation guidance and a local baseline verification record.
- Added module-scoped service resolution so service access is constrained by granted capabilities.
- Added runtime checks for UI contribution capabilities, module source identity, and factory/manifest identity alignment.
- Added an explicit host launch activation strategy for restore-only, development auto-activation, and specific module activation.
- Added Keychain-backed secure storage and OSLog-backed diagnostics for platform defaults.
- Added focused regression tests for activation restore, module identity validation, capability enforcement, host launch behavior, and platform service hardening.
- Added production starter Xcode templates for app modules, UI modules, service modules, and standalone module manifests.
- Added starter module files for app, UI, and service module authoring, including module manifests and SwiftUI views.
- Added `DeploymentMode` and template-local module registry support for template-created Forsetti app projects.
- Added `xcode-template-guide.md` with installation, removal, and template usage guidance.

### Changed

- Restored activation state is now reconciled through the normal activation path instead of being treated as already-live runtime state.
- UI/app module activation now follows the single-active UI model by default while service modules remain concurrently active.
- Production template rendering now waits for successful runtime boot and module activation before showing app module UI.
- `DefaultForsettiPlatformServices` now uses production-capable secure storage by default.
- `LocalFileExportService` now sanitizes suggested filenames and keeps exports inside the configured directory.
- Split large host root view responsibilities into focused SwiftUI components.
- Renamed `license.md` to `LICENSE.md` and updated references.
- Clarified that `version.txt`, `Sources/ForsettiCore/ForsettiVersion.swift`, and the README version marker are owned by the PR version workflow.
- Clarified that Release Please files remain retained release configuration state, while `.github/workflows/pr-version.yml` is the active PR-time version updater.
- Limited guardrail workflow push runs to `main` while preserving pull request checks.
- Moved comprehensive wiki documentation to the GitHub Wiki as the canonical long-form documentation surface.
- Rebuilt the Forsetti App Xcode template around an app module entry point instead of embedding application behavior directly in bootstrap code.
- Updated template installation and uninstallation scripts for the expanded Xcode template set.
- Expanded README coverage for the production starter templates and template-based app/module authoring workflow.

### Fixed

- Fixed persisted activation restore so restored modules are resolved, validated, started, loaded, and reconnected to UI surfaces.
- Fixed failed restore behavior so modules are not left falsely enabled after restore failures.
- Fixed factory mismatch handling so descriptor and manifest identity mismatches fail before lifecycle start.
- Fixed module context APIs so scoped modules cannot spoof source IDs when publishing events or sending module messages.
- Fixed stale entitlement change stream documentation and UI activation wording.

### Removed

- Removed `ForsettiModulesExample` from public package products while keeping the target available for internal examples and tests.
- Removed automated wiki publishing, documentation-release tagging, and source-splitting workflow files.
- Removed the repository-local wiki source file now that the GitHub Wiki is maintained directly.
- Removed tracked SwiftPM build products and Xcode workspace state from the repository.

## Documentation Release docs-v2 - 2026-04-11

### Added

- Added implementation guidance for consumers integrating Forsetti into application projects.
- Added a focused contributor brief for repository rules, expected workflows, and review boundaries.
- Added module boundary rules documentation covering allowed dependency directions and integration limits.

### Changed

- Clarified the README, developer guide, implementation guide, wiki source, and project instruction files for the second documentation release.
- Expanded the coding policy JSON with stronger repository invariants and documentation expectations.
- Tightened language around Forsetti as an Apple-native modular runtime, with clearer guidance on host apps, modules, and framework boundaries.

## Documentation Release docs-v1 / Version Baseline 0.1.0 - 2026-03-04

### Added

- Added release automation with Release Please configuration, version manifest data, and `version.txt`.
- Added documentation release automation for `docs-vN` tags and GitHub documentation releases.
- Added pull request title linting for conventional commit-style PR titles.
- Added README version references and release links for version `0.1.0`.

### Changed

- Updated `ForsettiVersion.current` to align the framework version with `0.1.0`.
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.DS_Store`, SwiftPM build products, SwiftPM workspace metadata, and wiki output pages.

## Initial Development - 2026-02-22 to 2026-03-03

### Added

- Added the SwiftPM package structure for `ForsettiCore`, `ForsettiPlatform`, `ForsettiModulesExample`, and `ForsettiHostTemplate`.
- Added core runtime contracts for manifests, modules, registries, compatibility checks, activation state, entitlements, services, eventing, logging, and UI contributions.
- Added host-template controller, catalog, overlay routing, view injection, and SwiftUI shell components.
- Added example service and UI modules with bundled Forsetti manifests.
- Added platform service and entitlement provider implementations.
- Added architecture, core runtime, host template, and platform test targets.
- Added guardrail scripts and CI workflow coverage for package tests, SwiftLint, architecture checks, and template installation checks.
- Added wiki publishing workflow support and a source-splitting script for README, guide, developer guide, and wiki source documents.
- Added proprietary licensing documentation and README licensing guidance.
- Added coding policy JSON and repository instruction metadata.

### Changed

- Hardened manifest loading with duplicate detection, subdirectory validation, and malformed manifest coverage.
- Hardened module activation and deactivation around compatibility failures, entitlement state, persisted activation, lifecycle cleanup, and runtime shutdown.
- Moved default platform services into the core service container so service dependencies remain injectable.
- Expanded runtime tests for compatibility checks, manifest loading, lifecycle behavior, module communication, module logging, UI surface management, and host controller behavior.
- Reworked the shell UI and runtime model to support active UI module selection alongside multiple enabled service modules.
- Expanded README, guide, developer guide, wiki source, and instruction documents to describe runtime invariants, deployment patterns, host integration, and module boundaries.
- Updated Xcode template bootstrap behavior to register template modules and align with the runtime entry point model.
- Added factory coverage for platform entitlement providers and improved template installation guidance.

### Fixed

- Corrected README module naming and documentation references.
- Corrected runtime and host-template naming around app modules and UI modules.
- Corrected module manager and host controller handling for selected UI modules.

### Removed

- Removed `.DS_Store` from the repository.
