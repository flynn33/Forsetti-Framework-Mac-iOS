# Execution Brief

Read this before implementing or modifying a Forsetti-based application or module.

## Framework truth

Forsetti is a modularity-first, object-oriented Apple-platform framework.

It is designed for iOS and macOS applications built in Xcode with Apple-native tools, libraries, and frameworks only.

This includes SwiftUI and Metal.

## High-risk misunderstanding to avoid

Do not misread target-level or layer-level import restrictions as global bans on Apple-native frameworks in app-owned modules.

That interpretation is wrong.

## Correct interpretation

In a multi-module single-application design:

- the application UI belongs in exactly one dedicated UI module
- that dedicated UI module may use SwiftUI and other Apple-native UI technologies
- service logic belongs in separate service modules
- Metal may be used in the correct module or layer when the module’s responsibility justifies it

## Operating rule

When deciding whether a technology is allowed, ask:

- which module owns this responsibility?
- is this the correct module or layer for this technology?

Do not ask:

- is this technology globally banned because one framework target cannot import it?

## Final reminder

Forsetti is not trying to keep you away from Apple-native frameworks.

Forsetti is trying to keep those frameworks in the correct module with strict modular boundaries.
