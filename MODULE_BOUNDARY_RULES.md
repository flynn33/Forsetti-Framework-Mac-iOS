# Module Boundary Rules

This document explains how to interpret Forsetti’s architectural boundaries correctly.

## Why this document exists

Developers and reviewers can misread boundary rules if they are written too tersely.

This document states the boundary rules explicitly so they are hard to misinterpret.

## Boundary Principle

Forsetti boundary rules control where responsibilities live.

They do not exist to ban Apple-native frameworks from consumer application code.

## Primary Rule

Ask this question first:

> Which module owns this responsibility?

Do not ask this question first:

> Is this Apple-native framework globally allowed or globally forbidden?

That is the wrong framing for Forsetti.

## UI Boundary Rule

In the multi-module single-application pattern:

- there must be exactly one dedicated UI module
- that UI module owns the application UI
- service modules remain separate from the UI module

The dedicated UI module may use SwiftUI and other Apple-native UI technologies.

This means the rule is about UI placement, not UI prohibition.

## Service Boundary Rule

Service modules own service responsibilities.

They should not be used as a dumping ground for unrelated UI responsibilities.

If a service module begins to own the application’s primary UI, the boundary has been broken.

## Rendering Boundary Rule

If a module owns rendering responsibilities, that module may use rendering-appropriate Apple-native technologies.

This includes Metal when the module’s responsibility justifies it.

Forsetti does not prohibit Metal.
Forsetti requires Metal to be used in the correct module or architectural layer.

## Import Restriction Interpretation Rule

If a Forsetti framework target has an import restriction, interpret that restriction narrowly and correctly.

Correct interpretation:

- that specific target/layer must not import that framework

Incorrect interpretation:

- no Forsetti-based application code may use that framework anywhere

Do not convert a target-level rule into a global technology ban.

## Consumer Application Rule

A consumer application may build app-owned Forsetti-compatible modules in its own targets.

Those app-owned modules may use Apple-native frameworks appropriate to their responsibilities, provided they respect Forsetti’s modular structure and public extension points.

## Explicit Allowed Technology Examples

The following are explicitly valid when used in the correct module or architectural layer:

- Swift
- SwiftUI
- Metal
- other Apple-native frameworks appropriate to the module’s responsibility

## Explicitly Wrong Conclusions

These conclusions are wrong and must not be used:

- “SwiftUI is framework-internal only.”
- “The UI module cannot use SwiftUI.”
- “Metal is disallowed unless the repo says otherwise in multiple places.”
- “A target-level import restriction inside Forsetti bans that framework from all app-owned modules.”
- “Modularity means avoiding native Apple frameworks.”

## Final Rule

Forsetti is a modularity-first Apple-native framework.

The architecture question is always:

> Is this technology being used in the correct module?

That is the correct interpretation rule.
